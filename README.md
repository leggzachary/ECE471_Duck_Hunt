# ECE471_Duck_Hunt
ECE 471 final project - Duck Hunt Challenge 


My code is in the *duck-hunt* directory. I only modified the *solution.py* file for my solution to this project.

To run the project:
 1. **Clone** this repo.
 2. **Open** *duck-hunt* directory.
 3. **Create** a virtualenv and **activate** it. 
 4. **Install** the required packages listed in *requirements.txt* by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 5. **Install** the Duck Hunt package by running: `pip install file-name.whl`.
> Note: I included all the .whl files in the repo. Use one for your system.
 6. **Run** the *duck_hunt_main_mp.py*
